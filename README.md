!important <b>Not Yet Finished</b>
<b>My library</b>

This is a personal project i made to store all API of many different languages.
it uses PHP/css/js and can run on local host for personal uses.
Although, i kind stopped software developing but who cares! if you make something, try to make it somewhat appealing and good.

anyway, more updates hopefully is coming soon to it.
